# ComfyBake: A marketplace platform for selling and buying home baked goodies
Deployed on Netlify: **https://agitated-khorana-63ac45.netlify.app/**

**Vision**: Efficiently connect home bakers with hungry customers or bakers looking for an app to sell their home baked goods and test interest

**Problem**: Homemade food and baked goods is labor intensive and requires a level of expertise AND Itâ€™s difficult to start a small business for baked goods without anything to wage off of

**Audience**: People who enjoy consuming homemade goods and selling their own baked goods

**Strategy**: Our teams provides efficient interactions via virtual storefronts

**Goal Reached**: Sellers can easily and intuitively create, edit, and delete home baked good menu items. Display menu items on the Home Page so Buyers can add to cart and purchase. Display checked out carts in order pages. Store accounts in Back-end to persist different account menus, orders, and data.
